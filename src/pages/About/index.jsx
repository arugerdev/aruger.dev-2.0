                Maybe I&apos;m too talkative and write too much about myself, but I like people to know me at least a little before thinking about working with me or not.

                I am fascinated by video games, and that is why I make them, they seem like an incredible way to express oneself creatively. My first videogame was God Of War 2, played on the ps2 where my older brother taught me to play with a console for the first time, after that I spent hours playing it over and over again, until I saw Kingdom Hearts 1, I loved its story and to this day it is still my favorite saga.

                I studied at a conservatory for 2 years and although I did not complete the entire course and did not receive the degree, I learned a lot of interesting things, and without a doubt, I am a good pianist.

                I have a FPB degree in Computer Science and Communications, and at the moment I am studying a GM to be a Technician in Microcomputer Systems and Networks. And in the not too distant future, I will study for the GS degree to be a Senior Technician in Web Application Development.

                Although at the moment it seems that I have few academic titles, in reality, I am in favor of learning much more on my own, being very curious in all aspects, I love knowing how everything works and I am always learning everything that comes my way .
